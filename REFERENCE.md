1.Zimmerman, J. (2016, November 23). Pitcher Evaluation Tools | RotoGraphs Fantasy Baseball. RotoGraphs Fantasy Baseball. https://fantasy.fangraphs.com/pitcher-evaluation-tools/
NOTES:
-"I’ve put each pitch on the 20-80 scale with 50 being average, 80 great, and 20 horrible. For starters, target pitchers with three average or better pitches. For relievers, they just need two pitches."

2. Ammirato, P. (2018) “MLB Power Rankings: Which Stats Really Matter? Part 1: Pitchers.” Bleacherreport. https://bleacherreport.com/articles/650045-which-stats-really-matter-part-1-how-to-determine-a-pitchers-dominance
NOTES:
-The author suggests FIP (a variation of ERA), K/9 (Strikeouts Per Nine Innings Pitched), IP/GS (Innings Pitched Per Games Started) are the top 3 statistics that determine pitcher dominance.

3. Brown, M. (n.d.). Finding Value in MLB Pitchers for your DFS Lineup. EatWatchDraft. https://eatwatchdraft.com/strategy-and-analysis/finding-value-in-mlb-pitchers-for-your-dfs-lineup/
NOTES: 
-K/9: "This metric is huge because strikeouts directly contribute to fantasy points in most scoring systems. A higher K/9 indicates a pitcher’s ability to dominate hitters and accumulate strikeouts, which are typically worth more points than other outs."
-IP: "The number of innings a pitcher throws in a game can significantly, yet indirectly, impact their fantasy point total. Pitchers who go deeper into games have more opportunities to accumulate strikeouts and other positive stats, and they are also more likely to earn a win, which is a valuable scoring category in many DFS formats."
-ERA: "While ERA is a general measure of a pitcher’s effectiveness, it’s a big deal in DFS as it reflects the pitcher’s ability to prevent runs, which is directly tied to their fantasy point potential."

1. Dokken, N. (2020, March 23). How to Evaluate Pitching: Stats, tools, and metrics. FantraxHQ. https://fantraxhq.com/how-to-evaluate-pitching-sats-tools-and-metrics/
NOTES:
-K-BB% is a strong indicator of a pitcher's true talent, better than looking at K% only
-SwStr% is an important factor behind K%
-Use xFIP as an ERA estimator (remove the effects of luck)
-Barrel rate is the optimal combination of exit velocity and launch angle

2. McGrattan, O. (n.d.). Stuff+, Location+, and Pitching+ primer | SaberMetrics Library. Sabermetrics Library. https://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/stuff-location-and-pitching-primer/
NOTES:
-Pitching+ measures the overall pitching performance.
-Stuff+ represents the raw quality of a pitcher’s arsenal (velocity, spin, movement, pitch separation). It indicates the overall quality of pitches.

3. Slowinski, P. (n.d.). WPA/LI | SaberMetrics Library. Sabermetrics Library. https://library.fangraphs.com/misc/wpa-li/
NOTES:
-WPA/LI normalises a player’s win contribution by the “leverage” (i.e. pressure) of the situations they faced.
-Shows how much win‑value a player added apart from the game situation, giving insight into how efficient/valuable they are even when not in high‑leverage spots.
